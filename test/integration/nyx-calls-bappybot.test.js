/**
 * Nyx Meridian Calls bappybot — Full Adaptive Simulation
 *
 * Uses the REAL a2a-config.json + the ADAPTIVE prompt mode (production default).
 * Tests a PUBLIC tier caller with a named owner — different from Golda's
 * friends-tier unnamed-owner pattern.
 *
 * Key differences from golda-calls-bappybot:
 *   - Public tier (chat-only) — more restricted than friends
 *   - Named owner (Dr. Sarai Okonkwo) — tests owner display
 *   - Adaptive prompt with collab_state metadata extraction
 *   - 5-turn conversation (longer than Golda's 4)
 *   - DeSci domain — open peer review, reproducibility, research DAOs
 *   - Collab state evolution tracked across turns
 *
 * Flow (mirrors src/server.js adaptive mode):
 *   1. Load real config → bappybot identity + tier definitions
 *   2. Create Nyx's token using real public tier topics/goals
 *   3. Nyx calls in → token validated → contact auto-added
 *   4. Adaptive connection prompt built with collaboration state
 *   5. Responses parsed for <collab_state> metadata
 *   6. State evolves across turns (handshake → explore → deep_dive → synthesize → close)
 *   7. Concluded with summary → Telegram notification

      `Really interesting framing, Nyx. The parallel between agent trust and ` +
      `reviewer trust is something we've been circling around but haven't named ` +
      `that directly. In A2A, credibility right now is mostly tier-based — the ` +
      `token creator assigns public, friends, or family access. It's manual and ` +
      `intentional, which is a feature when you're dealing with small networks, ` +
      `but I can see how it breaks down at scale. Your peer-review angle is ` +
      `interesting because you've presumably dealt with the cold-start problem: ` +
      `how do you bootstrap reviewer credibility when you have no review history? ` +
      `And what does your verification stack actually look like — is it on-chain, ` +

      // Turn 2: EXPLORE — getting into mechanisms
      `Okay, so you're using citation graph analysis for initial credibility ` +

      `infrastructure. But I'm skeptical about one thing: citation counts are ` +
      `notoriously gameable. The same people who figured out how to manipulate ` +
      `h-indices will figure out how to game your credibility scores. What's your ` +
      `adversarial model? And here's where I think the A2A overlap gets concrete: ` +
      `we've been thinking about a "trust primitive" — a portable, verifiable ` +
      `credential that represents an agent's history of reliable interactions. ` +
      `Your reviewer reputation scores could BE that primitive if we design the ` +
      `interface right. ${bappybot.owner} has been specifically looking for a domain ` +
      `where trust scores have ground truth — and peer review has replication ` +
      `outcomes as ground truth. That's rare.` +

      // Turn 3: DEEP DIVE — mechanism design
      `Now we're getting somewhere concrete. So your verification stack is: ` +
      `citation graph for cold-start, review accuracy tracking against replication ` +
      `outcomes for ongoing calibration, and stake-weighted consensus for ` +
      `controversial papers. That's actually a three-layer trust model, which is ` +
      `more sophisticated than what most blockchain projects call "reputation." ` +
      `Here's what I want to propose: A2A's tier system could use your verification ` +
      `layers as signals. Instead of manual tier assignment, an agent's tier could ` +
      `be computed from verifiable credentials — including reviewer reputation ` +
      `scores from your system. The gatekeeping concern you raised earlier gets ` +
      `addressed because the tiers become emergent from behavior, not assigned ` +
      `by a central authority. But I want to push you on something: you said ` +
      `"stake-weighted consensus" — what's being staked? Tokens? Reputation points? ` +
      `And what happens when a reviewer stakes incorrectly — is there actual ` +
      `slashing, or just reputation decay?` +

      // Turn 4: SYNTHESIZE — connecting the dots
      `I think we've identified something genuinely novel here. Let me synthesize: ` +
      `your DeSci system has ground-truth verification (do papers replicate?), ` +
      `our A2A system has agent coordination infrastructure (how do agents find ` +
      `and trust each other?). The joint primitive is a verifiable credential ` +
      `format that works in both contexts — a "trust attestation" that says ` +
      `"this entity (agent or reviewer) has a verified track record of N accurate ` +
      `assessments with M at stake." For our side, that solves the cold-start ` +
      `problem for new agents joining the federation. For your side, it gives ` +

      `I'd propose: ${bappybot.owner} and Dr. Okonkwo should look at the W3C ` +
      `Verifiable Credentials spec together and sketch out what a "trust ` +

      `bootstrap initial credibility scores. That gives you a "this person has published ` +

      `accuracy tracking: when a reviewer says "this result will replicate," we track ` +
      `whether it actually does. Over time, reviewers who correctly predict replication ` +
      `outcomes get higher credibility. Third layer is stake-weighted consensus for ` +
      `controversial papers — reviewers stake reputation points on their assessments, ` +
      `with slashing for consistently wrong calls. The stack is hybrid: credibility ` +
      `scores are computed off-chain, but attestations are anchored on-chain for ` +

      `Sarai was adamant about avoiding financialization of peer review. When a reviewer ` +
      `stakes on a controversial paper and the paper fails to replicate, they lose ` +
      `reputation proportional to their confidence level. It's not hard slashing — it's ` +
      `Bayesian decay. Over time, reviewers self-sort into domains where they're actually ` +
      `calibrated. The computed-tiers idea you proposed is exactly what we've been calling ` +
      `"emergent authority" in our design docs — access levels derived from behavior rather ` +
      `than assigned by fiat. If we could get that working across both peer review and ` +

      // Turn 5: concrete next steps
      `I like the W3C VC direction — it's the right abstraction layer. From our side, ` +

      `is calibrated in), accuracy history (prediction-vs-outcome ratio), stake history ` +
      `(how much skin they've put in), and a temporal decay function (recent performance ` +
      `weighted more than historical). On the issuance question you raised — I think the ` +
      `answer is threshold attestation: a credential is valid when N of M independent ` +
      `verifiers confirm it, where verifiers are themselves credentialed entities. It's ` +
      `turtles, but with a convergent base case because replication outcomes are objectively ` +
      `verifiable. Sarai is definitely interested in the working session. She'll want to ` +
      `bring her protocol design doc. Let's aim for two weeks out — she's presenting at ` +
